Installation is really easy and there are no additional files required except for
the actual data file which you download from here:
https://software77.net/cgi-bin/ip-country/geo-ip.pl
(or you can use someone else's provided the format is the same)

Uploading instructions, setting of parameters and variables are
all documented below. Enjoy!

1) Make sure the first line of the script points to Perl for your server. The
   default is: #!/usr/bin/perl. It can also be #!/usr/local/bin/perl on some
   servers.
2) Upload the script to a web accessible directory on your server that can execute
   CGI scripts. For example the cgi-bin directory on your website.
3) Make sure you upload the script in ASCII mode or it won't work.

4) CHMOD it to 755.
5) Unzip the file you downloaded from https://software77.net/cgi-bin/ip-country/geo-ip.pl
   and upload it to the same directory as the script. If you call it 'IpToCountry.csv'
   on your server (Case Sensitive!!) you won't need to change anything in the Perl code.
6) There are only 3 variables you worth mentioning in the code you can change:
my $geofile = 'IpToCountry.csv';
The name of the data file. If you put it elsewhere on your server, be sure
to include the full path here.

my $date_delimiter = '-';
The symbol used between the parts of the date

my $date_format = 'mmm-dd-yyyy';
The display format of the date.
7) Don't forget to update your database form time to time by downloading the latest data file.
